# Home-Tp-bukkit

**Home-Tp** is a lightweight Bukkit plugin that adds basic teleportation commands, ideal for survival servers that want `/sethome`, `/home`, and `/tpa` functionality without bloat.

I made this plugin for my own peace of mind regarding what exactly I'm putting into my server, I figured others would enjoy it too

## ✨ Features

- `/sethome` – Set your personal home location  
- `/home` – Instantly teleport to your home  
- `/tpa <player>` – Teleport directly to another player (no request system as of 1.0)

## 🔐 Permissions

| Command     | Permission        | Description                    |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| `/sethome`  | `hometp.sethome`  | Allows setting a home point   |
| `/home`     | `hometp.home`     | Allows teleporting to home    |
| `/tpa`      | `hometp.tpa`      | Allows teleporting to players |
